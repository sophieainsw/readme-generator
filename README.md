# ReadME Generator

For this challenge I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file.

This is created using the user's input using the Inquirer package.

The application is used in the command line using node index.js.

This will help developers quickly create a professional readme for new projects.

I used markdown to add styling to the readme.
